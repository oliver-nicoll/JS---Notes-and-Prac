# OBJECTS
    Objects in real life have properties and things they can do:
        PROPERTIES-
            color
            size
            model
        
        THINGS IT CAN DO-
            ring
            take a picture
            play music
    
    Objects in JS have properties & things they can do (like methods):

    EXAMPLES:
        USER OBJECT-
            PROPERTIES:
                email
                username
                gender
            
            METHODS(just functions):
                login 
                logout
                
        BLOG OBJECT-
            PROPERTIES:
                title
                content
                author
        
            METHODS(functions):
                publish
                unpublish
                delete

## Object Literals

    See file: obj_literals.js for examples and notes

## Math Object

    See file: math_obj.js for examples and notes

## JavaScript Data Types:

    Number: 1, 2, 3, 100, 3.14

    String: "Hello World", 'test@email.com'

    Boolean: true/ false

    Null: Explicitly set a variable with no value

    Undefined: For variables that have not yet been defined

    Object: Arrays, Object Literals, Functions, Dates etc.

    Symbol: Used with objects

## Primative vs Reference Types

    Have to do with How they are stored in memory. 


        Primitive Types:
            numbers
            strings
            booleans
            null
            undefined
            symbols

                Stored in the stack - limited space and quicker

        Reference Types:
            All types of objects
            object literals
            arrays
            functions
            dates
            all other objects

                Stored in the heap - but slower than the stack
